## Setext headings


Example: 93


```````````````````````````````` example
> foo
bar
===
.
<blockquote>
<h1>foo
bar</h1>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

Example: 300

h2 setext headings is confusion, it is the same with `<hr>`. Because there
is a logic for `<hr>` to interupt list, I would like to make it simpler:


```````````````````````````````` example
- # Foo
- Bar
  ---
  baz
.
<ul>
<li>
<h1>Foo</h1>
</li>
<li>Bar</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>baz</p>
````````````````````````````````

However, if the dash is less than 3, it is not a `<hr>`, in this case, it
can be rendered into `<h2>`.

```````````````````````````````` example
- # Foo
- Bar
  --
  baz
.
<ul>
<li>
<h1>Foo</h1>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Bar</h2>
baz</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````
