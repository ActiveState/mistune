Fix problems that commonmark has.


## Links

Links can't contain links.

```````````````````````````````` example
[<https://example.com>](/foo)
.
<p><a href="/foo">&lt;https://example.com&gt;</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

## Emphasis

`<em>` doesn't contain `<em>`, `<strong>` doesn't contain `<strong>`.

```````````````````````````````` example
*_em_* __**strong**__ ______m______
.
<p><em>_em_</em> <strong>**strong**</strong> ___<em><strong>m</strong></em>___</p>
````````````````````````````````

### Non aggressive emphasis

```````````````````````````````` example
*a **b c* d**
.
<p><em>a **b c</em> d**</p>
````````````````````````````````

While CommonMark would render it into:

```
<p><em>a <em><em>b c</em> d</em></em></p>
```

```````````````````````````````` example
*a **b c* d**
.
<p><em>a **b c</em> d**</p>
````````````````````````````````

While CommonMark would render it into:

```
<p><em>a <em><em>b c</em> d</em></em></p>
```

What if the string is:

```````````````````````````````` example
*a **b c* d
.
<p><em>a **b c</em> d</p>
````````````````````````````````

CommonMark would still be a mess:

```
<p>*a *<em>b c</em> d</p>
```

There are so many insane cases for emphasis, people
shouldn't write such text. There are cases CommonMark
are bad at, and there are cases Mistune bad at.

For example:

```
*a **b** d*
```

Because Mistune is not aggressive on emphasis parsing,
it will find `b*` as the emphasis end, in this case,
the final result would be:


```````````````````````````````` example
*a **b** d*
.
<p><em>a **b</em>* d*</p>
````````````````````````````````
